cd commands:

  (1)An example of using the command with no arguments:

  ![Image](cd1.png)

  The working directory when the command runs is the root.
  
  There is no output because cd means change directory, but with no argument, the terminal will not change the directory(stay the same).

  The output is not an error.

  (2)An example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument:

  ![Image](cd2.png)

  The working directory when the command runs is now in lecture1.

  The directory is new changing from root to lecture1 since the cd command changed the previous directory into the argument we typed in as a new   directory we are working on (if it exists).

  The output is not an error.

  (3)An example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument:

  ![Image](cd3.png)

  Even though I put en-us.txt as an argument, but the directory when the command runs is still the messages directory.

  The directory is not changing because there is no such directory that matches my input argument, so it will remain in the current directory.

  The output is an error, this is because en-us.txt is a file that cannot be used as a directory to change. So the change directory command is     not applied.
