cd commands:

  (1)An example of using the command with no arguments:

  ![Image](cd1.png)

  The working directory when the command runs is the root.
  
  There is no output because cd means change directory, but with no argument, the terminal will not change the directory.

  The output is not an error.

  (2)An example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument:

  ![Image](cd2.png)

  The working directory when the command runs is now in lecture1.

  The directory is new changing from root to lecture1 since the cd command changed the previous directory into the argument we typed in as a new   directory we are working on (if it exists).

  The output is not an error.
